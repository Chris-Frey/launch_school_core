quesiton 1
a = object id 1
b = object id 2
c = object id 1

question 2
all same object ID because integers are immutable (can't be changed)

question 3
the string will show rutababga next to the word pumpkins <<< this is wrong. 

the string will show pumpkins because inside the method, the string is reassigned to a new object (rutabaga) which does not affect the string object on the outside of the method. so the call in the "puts" line, is only asking for the pumpkin.

the array will add rutabaga as another piece of the array, in index position 1. inside the method, rutababga is appended to the array, since it's not "changing the array".

Question 4
string shows "my string looks like this now: pumpkinsrutabaga
array shows "my array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"].... this is because inside the method, it's trying to redefine the array, which can't be read outside the method.

question 5
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param += ["rutabaga"]  <<< adjust this to be +=

  return a_string_param, an_array_param
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
my_string, my_array = tricky_method(my_string, my_array)   <<< add this line

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

question 6
def color_valid(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green" ? true : false   
end
puts color_valid("green")

or

def color_valid(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green"
end
