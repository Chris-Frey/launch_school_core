question 2
1. != means not equal to. use it when you have a small number of cases you don't want to happen (like you'll accept any number EXCEPT 7)
2. ! before a word returns 'true' if 2 objects are not equal. otherwise false.
3. putting ! after something typically makes it a mutating action
4.? before something is the ternary operator for if...else
5. putting ? after something typically means you're asking if the action is true or not
6. !! before something turns it into a boolean.

question 3
advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
advice.split
advice[6] = "urgent"

question 4
numbers.delete_at(1) will delete at the second index position in the array (the number "2" in this case)
numbers.delete(1) will delete any instances of the number "1"

question 5
(10..100).include?(42)

question 6
famous_words = "seven years ago..."
lincoln = "four score and " + #{famous_words}

or

famous_words = "seven years ago..."
lincoln = "four score and "
puts #{lincoln} + #{famous_words}

question 7
flinstones = ["Fred", "Wilma", ["Barney", "Betty"], ["BamBam", "Pebbles"]]
puts flinstones.flatten!

quesiton 8
Turn this into an array containing only two elements: Barney's name and Barney's number
flintstones = { "Fred" => 0, "Wilma" => 1, "Barney" => 2, "Betty" => 3, "BamBam" => 4, "Pebbles" => 5 }
flinstones.assoc("Barney")
