question 1
throws an error  <<< this is wrong. it returns 'nil'

question 2
'hi there'
if a = b, then it's also true(?) that b = a. so modifying one will change the other.  

question 3
A: one is one, two is two, three is three
B: same as above
C: one is two, two is three, three is one

question 4
def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  return false unless dot_separated_words.size == 4

  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    return false unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
  end
  
  true
end

dot_separated_ip_address?("10.4.5.11")
