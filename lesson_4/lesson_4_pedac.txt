Questions:
  what is a substring
  what is a palindrome
  will inputs always be strings?
  what does it mean to treat palindrome words case-sensitive?
input
  strings
output
  all substrings from strings which are palindromes, in an array

implicit rules
  palindromes can get letters inside a word, not necessarily whole words
  words with no palindromes should return a empty array
  letters can be used more than once 
  blank strings should return empty array

explicit rules
  words are case sensative (capitalized word would not be a valid result)
